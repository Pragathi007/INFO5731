"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live
"You have a video of a holiday in the past, when you were young, before life's burdens had amassed, with a father you adore, likes to take to the dancefloor, though he's generally withdrawn and quite downcast. A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",video holiday past young life burden amass father ador like take dancefloor though he gener withdrawn quit downcast reflect time eye new interpret seed yet grow look back differ world somehow reveal space yet enter sought goit slow meander beauti film two incred perform although two highlight alon dont creat piec take breath away much might like sit reflect absorb youv seen eye
"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack.

"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone.

"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents.

"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",aftersun doesnt necessarili dive deep main subject matter think work favourdel unravel stori two charact spend holiday togeth scene scene given clue calum mental health he subsequ battl depressionwhat realli make special primarili play perspect sophi daughter child mind harder notic emot trigger mood chang would red flag adultwhil film definit slow burner work perfectli case simpli watch father daughter enjoy seemingli normal holiday time see sneak peek calum mind much he struggl he still tri give sophi best holiday possibl start feel slow tension build throughout film hit opinion realli heavi endingfor final scene follow credit left confus initi within second start fall place final realis sophi last time spent father like commit suicid watch back adult perspect realis father cope still tri absolut best make special herthi film wouldnt work film way slow pace realli give viewer time take everyth small detail count excel film excel act great soundtrack highli recommend
"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone. I really don't care about downvoting but this movie's theme made me chose carefully my words because i respect what this movie mean to some people.",lot peopl got emot watch movi touch soul respect care write reviewi didnt connect charact woman daughter mayb would empath wouldnt bet gener dont need connect person level charact order enjoy movi felt distanc couldnt understand watch hint first hour someth wrong point watch father daughter vacat total uninterest watch end act great mescal corio excel wait someth happen happen littl late last minut intens sure still couldnt understand end search web interpret mean point thought differ outcom thought father bad person got wrong seemsther good scene father daughter danc sound david bowi end sad beauti scene especi listen particular song lyric chemistri great realli felt love othersubtleti great director skill never go full subtl movi poem certain level connect event charact necessari love poeticdream likeart movi case need strong imageri deep mean substanc style beauti cinematographi etc movi didnt provid anyth thati hope didnt offend anyon realli dont care downvot movi theme made chose care word respect movi mean peopl
"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio.

The performances left me totally speechless.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",video holiday past young life burden amass father ador like take dancefloor though he gener withdrawn quit downcast reflect time eye new interpret seed yet grow look back differ world somehow reveal space yet enter sought goit slow meander beauti film two incred perform although two highlight alon dont creat piec take breath away much might like sit reflect absorb youv seen eye
"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack.

"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone. I really don't care about downvoting but this movie's theme made me chose carefully my words because i respect what this movie mean to some people.",lot peopl got emot watch movi touch soul respect care write reviewi didnt connect charact woman daughter mayb would empath wouldnt bet gener dont need connect person level charact order enjoy movi felt distanc couldnt understand watch hint first hour someth wrong point watch father daughter vacat total uninterest watch end act great mescal corio excel wait someth happen happen littl late last minut intens sure still couldnt understand end search web interpret mean point thought differ outcom thought father bad person got wrong seemsther good scene father daughter danc sound david bowi end sad beauti scene especi listen particular song lyric chemistri great realli felt love othersubtleti great director skill never go full subtl movi poem certain level connect event charact necessari love poeticdream likeart movi case need strong imageri deep mean substanc style beauti cinematographi etc movi didnt provid anyth thati hope didnt offend anyon realli dont care downvot movi theme made chose care word respect movi mean peopl
"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio.

"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry. I can't even think of this movie without feeling knots in my throat.This is such a heartbreaking portrait of parenthood with depression, specifically the perpetual pursuit of keeping that side of you from your child, for the sake of making lasting memories with them.The little details and layers upon layers to the characters is just spectacular. The performances left me totally speechless. The subtlety and the natural flow of the dialogue and interactions takes a screenwriter with a DEEP understanding of the human condition.It isn't until we get older that we begin to understand the true anxiety and despair of being an adult, being our parents, and that the vision we had of our future selves at 11 years old was totally unrealistic and ridiculous, specifically for those of us whose anxiety and depression reveals itself to us later in life.",rememb time film made cri cant even think movi without feel knot throatthi heartbreak portrait parenthood depress specif perpetu pursuit keep side child sake make last memori themth littl detail layer upon layer charact spectacular perform left total speechless subtleti natur flow dialogu interact take screenwrit deep understand human conditionit isnt get older begin understand true anxieti despair adult parent vision futur self year old total unrealist ridicul specif u whose anxieti depress reveal u later life
"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title.

"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok.

That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",aftersun doesnt necessarili dive deep main subject matter think work favourdel unravel stori two charact spend holiday togeth scene scene given clue calum mental health he subsequ battl depressionwhat realli make special primarili play perspect sophi daughter child mind harder notic emot trigger mood chang would red flag adultwhil film definit slow burner work perfectli case simpli watch father daughter enjoy seemingli normal holiday time see sneak peek calum mind much he struggl he still tri give sophi best holiday possibl start feel slow tension build throughout film hit opinion realli heavi endingfor final scene follow credit left confus initi within second start fall place final realis sophi last time spent father like commit suicid watch back adult perspect realis father cope still tri absolut best make special herthi film wouldnt work film way slow pace realli give viewer time take everyth small detail count excel film excel act great soundtrack highli recommend
"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased.

"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story.

"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone. I really don't care about downvoting but this movie's theme made me chose carefully my words because i respect what this movie mean to some people.",lot peopl got emot watch movi touch soul respect care write reviewi didnt connect charact woman daughter mayb would empath wouldnt bet gener dont need connect person level charact order enjoy movi felt distanc couldnt understand watch hint first hour someth wrong point watch father daughter vacat total uninterest watch end act great mescal corio excel wait someth happen happen littl late last minut intens sure still couldnt understand end search web interpret mean point thought differ outcom thought father bad person got wrong seemsther good scene father daughter danc sound david bowi end sad beauti scene especi listen particular song lyric chemistri great realli felt love othersubtleti great director skill never go full subtl movi poem certain level connect event charact necessari love poeticdream likeart movi case need strong imageri deep mean substanc style beauti cinematographi etc movi didnt provid anyth thati hope didnt offend anyon realli dont care downvot movi theme made chose care word respect movi mean peopl
"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio.

"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry.

The performances left me totally speechless.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw
"After watching this beautiful film and coming across a little note from the amazing storyteller Charlotte Wells:(I cannot share URL apparently so please search ""A note from Charlotte Wells from the site of A24."")This was the word that broke me down. Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack.

"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone.

"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation.

"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live
"You have a video of a holiday in the past, when you were young, before life's burdens had amassed, with a father you adore, likes to take to the dancefloor, though he's generally withdrawn and quite downcast. A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",video holiday past young life burden amass father ador like take dancefloor though he gener withdrawn quit downcast reflect time eye new interpret seed yet grow look back differ world somehow reveal space yet enter sought goit slow meander beauti film two incred perform although two highlight alon dont creat piec take breath away much might like sit reflect absorb youv seen eye
"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",aftersun doesnt necessarili dive deep main subject matter think work favourdel unravel stori two charact spend holiday togeth scene scene given clue calum mental health he subsequ battl depressionwhat realli make special primarili play perspect sophi daughter child mind harder notic emot trigger mood chang would red flag adultwhil film definit slow burner work perfectli case simpli watch father daughter enjoy seemingli normal holiday time see sneak peek calum mind much he struggl he still tri give sophi best holiday possibl start feel slow tension build throughout film hit opinion realli heavi endingfor final scene follow credit left confus initi within second start fall place final realis sophi last time spent father like commit suicid watch back adult perspect realis father cope still tri absolut best make special herthi film wouldnt work film way slow pace realli give viewer time take everyth small detail count excel film excel act great soundtrack highli recommend
"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem.

"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",video holiday past young life burden amass father ador like take dancefloor though he gener withdrawn quit downcast reflect time eye new interpret seed yet grow look back differ world somehow reveal space yet enter sought goit slow meander beauti film two incred perform although two highlight alon dont creat piec take breath away much might like sit reflect absorb youv seen eye
"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack.

"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone. I really don't care about downvoting but this movie's theme made me chose carefully my words because i respect what this movie mean to some people.",lot peopl got emot watch movi touch soul respect care write reviewi didnt connect charact woman daughter mayb would empath wouldnt bet gener dont need connect person level charact order enjoy movi felt distanc couldnt understand watch hint first hour someth wrong point watch father daughter vacat total uninterest watch end act great mescal corio excel wait someth happen happen littl late last minut intens sure still couldnt understand end search web interpret mean point thought differ outcom thought father bad person got wrong seemsther good scene father daughter danc sound david bowi end sad beauti scene especi listen particular song lyric chemistri great realli felt love othersubtleti great director skill never go full subtl movi poem certain level connect event charact necessari love poeticdream likeart movi case need strong imageri deep mean substanc style beauti cinematographi etc movi didnt provid anyth thati hope didnt offend anyon realli dont care downvot movi theme made chose care word respect movi mean peopl
"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio.

"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry. I can't even think of this movie without feeling knots in my throat.This is such a heartbreaking portrait of parenthood with depression, specifically the perpetual pursuit of keeping that side of you from your child, for the sake of making lasting memories with them.The little details and layers upon layers to the characters is just spectacular. The performances left me totally speechless. The subtlety and the natural flow of the dialogue and interactions takes a screenwriter with a DEEP understanding of the human condition.It isn't until we get older that we begin to understand the true anxiety and despair of being an adult, being our parents, and that the vision we had of our future selves at 11 years old was totally unrealistic and ridiculous, specifically for those of us whose anxiety and depression reveals itself to us later in life.",rememb time film made cri cant even think movi without feel knot throatthi heartbreak portrait parenthood depress specif perpetu pursuit keep side child sake make last memori themth littl detail layer upon layer charact spectacular perform left total speechless subtleti natur flow dialogu interact take screenwrit deep understand human conditionit isnt get older begin understand true anxieti despair adult parent vision futur self year old total unrealist ridicul specif u whose anxieti depress reveal u later life
"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title.

"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok.

That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",aftersun doesnt necessarili dive deep main subject matter think work favourdel unravel stori two charact spend holiday togeth scene scene given clue calum mental health he subsequ battl depressionwhat realli make special primarili play perspect sophi daughter child mind harder notic emot trigger mood chang would red flag adultwhil film definit slow burner work perfectli case simpli watch father daughter enjoy seemingli normal holiday time see sneak peek calum mind much he struggl he still tri give sophi best holiday possibl start feel slow tension build throughout film hit opinion realli heavi endingfor final scene follow credit left confus initi within second start fall place final realis sophi last time spent father like commit suicid watch back adult perspect realis father cope still tri absolut best make special herthi film wouldnt work film way slow pace realli give viewer time take everyth small detail count excel film excel act great soundtrack highli recommend
"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased.

"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story.

"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone. I really don't care about downvoting but this movie's theme made me chose carefully my words because i respect what this movie mean to some people.",lot peopl got emot watch movi touch soul respect care write reviewi didnt connect charact woman daughter mayb would empath wouldnt bet gener dont need connect person level charact order enjoy movi felt distanc couldnt understand watch hint first hour someth wrong point watch father daughter vacat total uninterest watch end act great mescal corio excel wait someth happen happen littl late last minut intens sure still couldnt understand end search web interpret mean point thought differ outcom thought father bad person got wrong seemsther good scene father daughter danc sound david bowi end sad beauti scene especi listen particular song lyric chemistri great realli felt love othersubtleti great director skill never go full subtl movi poem certain level connect event charact necessari love poeticdream likeart movi case need strong imageri deep mean substanc style beauti cinematographi etc movi didnt provid anyth thati hope didnt offend anyon realli dont care downvot movi theme made chose care word respect movi mean peopl
"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio.

"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry.

The performances left me totally speechless.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live

"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw
"After watching this beautiful film and coming across a little note from the amazing storyteller Charlotte Wells:(I cannot share URL apparently so please search ""A note from Charlotte Wells from the site of A24."")This was the word that broke me down. Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack.

"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone.

"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation.

"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry.

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",oof movi hurtaftersun slow build climax left openli weep point sit theater bit end credit compos myselfit doesnt even seem much melancholi stori dad preteen daughter tri enjoy vacat rundown resort man end come along wallop realiz movi much that gradual reveal layer alongi serious cant even think movi without tear think end dad want give daughter fun vacat sink black hole depress daughter young fulli understand depth dad despair want adult go back time help want bawleasili one best movi saw year movi award taken serious film would nomin placegrad
"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",like best art writerdirector charlott well film must seen appreci fulli felt understood like fragment famili depict film requir viewer connect engag commitmentfor exampl first view one wouldnt know darkhair woman danc adult sophi whose memori holiday father year earlier make narr danc montag recur sever time end last night turkish holiday young sophi declin dad colum invit danc see adult version danc girl charactrerist even he danc danc aloneth end wind back begin film open sophi film play interview father two day birthday scene repeat later airport part colum film young sophi play duck pose widegrin wave still grin freez wall blowup well pan adult sophi flat show pensiv woman birthday pan continu back sophi last view colum paus camera walk back hall disappear behind distant door lastshot door defin hie absencelik last long pan three set film constantli play time instead throughway narr get discontinu experi rememb shuffl reexamin memori muddl explain frequent asynchron sound imag odd hear colum phone one posit see quit anoth tuck sophi bed sometim wear cast sometim doesntth key ambigu shot colum walk fullydress night sea explicit suicid star born next scene he back hotel room linear ploy would return shore narr make jumbl uncertainti key principl scene suggest suicid within narr period point leav adult sophi search memori deal itth film central ironi rare extend visit young girl prof pois charact matur adult father reveal weak troubl helpless child franki corio perform sophi miracul everi look suggest profound complex feel freez frame read she lock hotel room sophi coolli sleep lobbi tri assuag colum guilt cover father nake bodi bed she adult tuck kidsophi unruffl overhear two young girl discuss sexual activ sexual play teen meet pool game teen later heavi drink even spot two gay men kiss doorway latter may shade colum new thing go keith matteroffactli tell colum kiss young michaelwhen colum tell grow feel free tell anyth shot small float distanc wide expans water hill background scale convey futil colum promis helpless support herin earli shot hear sophi steadi breath asleep foreground balconi behind colum labour tai chi exercis smoke deepli troubl colum read medit tai chi he loos end girlfriend job sophi descript fatigu camera shift show face regist far profound exhaustionh also money troubl see sophi gift allinclus resort bracelet colum pick cigarett butt smoke overreact sophi loss swim mask complain hotel room provid le paid sophi skip restaur bill rare impati ask keep promis thing ie sing lesson know cant afford purchas expens carpet seem deni buy spirit gloom joy glad see adult sophi flatov colum unseen heavi breath see adult sophi rise bed assur woman partner shell tend cri babi son blurri montag colum lead wakeup call day trip celebr birthday young sophi enlist tourist stranger serenad cut jolli good fellow colum sob helplessli nake alon dark roomat last supper colum pay polaroid snap togeth sophi wist wish could stay resort forev watch photo slowli develop firm clariti miniatur slowli reveal montag absorbingand titl wise wife ann suggest aftersun sound like catchi name sunguard lotion someth treat burn see colum appli protect balm sophi time cascad memori attempt salv emot sear aftersun also seem inflect afternoon halfway divis day extens pivot point sophi complic memori dad
"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",aftersun film wasnt sure understood credit start roll sat thought everyth seen came believ kind geniuswhat movi lack overt substant plot make authent subtl placement characterbuild imag dialogu moment often feel like tangent overal pictur isnt clearwhil make frustrat first view clariti come film final shot suddenli put everyth perspect felt overwhelm flood emot two central characterssuff happen often silenc cumul film mani quiet moment drive home one effect nuanc messag compass ive seen yearthi masterpiec subtleti arguabl slightli fault refresh see age hammer head messag movi current live
"You have a video of a holiday in the past, when you were young, before life's burdens had amassed, with a father you adore, likes to take to the dancefloor, though he's generally withdrawn and quite downcast. A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",video holiday past young life burden amass father ador like take dancefloor though he gener withdrawn quit downcast reflect time eye new interpret seed yet grow look back differ world somehow reveal space yet enter sought goit slow meander beauti film two incred perform although two highlight alon dont creat piec take breath away much might like sit reflect absorb youv seen eye
"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",almost never watch film twice aftersun rare case absolut dont think film fulli appreci first watch saw someon suggest watch mind go back littl moment reevalu signific watch full pictur give entir movi differ perspect second watch almost like watch differ filmkid film particularli lead role often annoy isnt issu franki corio give one likeabl child perform ever rememb see chemistri paul mescal amaz read wasnt privi mescal solo scene rehears wasnt fulli awar charact go much charact sophi wasnt that brilliantsometh appar second view signific music movi first time rememb think lot good song movi second view realis everi song use tell stori tell go like peopl real world hear bang song nod head later reconsid true meaningfin film one beast movi end rememb see classi heavi thought done beauti somewhat haunt way stick long time
"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",film seem pedestrian first long stori rather slow mundan requir patienc allow settl might seem labour bore rather simplist stori father daughter routin stuff weve done packag holiday im surpris find odd prais high film act isnt much overt strain act chop noth address directli sceptic last min howev realis film exploit art storytel place retic feel time overwhelm say feel studi depress regret turn poignant real end mani said need see fulli grasp nuanc find rememb good testament stori accomplish act direct albeit slight almost whisper hot breez ill set understood dont read havent seen ithi self loath reveal hemid normal conversationspit face bathroom mirror maintain pretenc normal talk daughter beyond bathroom door perhap first outright confirm depress full lack selfworth steep self berat action often accompani depressionearli sign danc silenc balconi smoke mental health wasnt great offkilt inappropri moment danc silenc danc oddli selfcomfort nearli talk quiteth dim strobe scene danc sophi adult flash glimps see adult mother couldnt see seriou somewhat unhing man realiti state mind fail see child contrast well fond memori last holiday one moment recal fail wake let share room lock perhap metaphor emot gain access found nake bed perhap particular memori clue odd behavior recal see vulner last perhap clearli pull sheet bodi comfort protect keep watch balconyi found place death unclear although dont think meant know exactli believ stay turkey howev thought hand airport london sign mark london luton chaperon noncontemporan shot earlier walk sea night turkey clear signal intent perhap past commit suicid mayb exact place confus doesnt chang sens loss filmther palpabl feel regret exhibit linger love still daughter mother there sens onesid allud daughter say love your longer togeth also pictur man hasnt abl cope world succeed happen care dwell pressur men succeed provid contribut high rate suicid men confirm daughter berat offer pay sing lesson know cant pay shame evid hereit easi see film mundan tell father daughter typic holiday howev grasp inner turmoil outset knowledg transform experi culmin formid profoundli sad stori regret trauma daughter young time see subtleti depress man father love much look back suffer live loss angst mani feel notic lovedon aw stage take life didnt notic there huge guilt left behind consequencein end film real cinema remind much french cinema accomplish profoundli sad move
"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",write review rememb later gave movi understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci nuanc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw

Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomen cinematographi color palett gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isnt later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesnt mean everyth okay insid
"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",aftersun doesnt necessarili dive deep main subject matter think work favourdel unravel stori two charact spend holiday togeth scene scene given clue calum mental health he subsequ battl depressionwhat realli make special primarili play perspect sophi daughter child mind harder notic emot trigger mood chang would red flag adultwhil film definit slow burner work perfectli case simpli watch father daughter enjoy seemingli normal holiday time see sneak peek calum mind much he struggl he still tri give sophi best holiday possibl start feel slow tension build throughout film hit opinion realli heavi endingfor final scene follow credit left confus initi within second start fall place final realis sophi last time spent father like commit suicid watch back adult perspect realis father cope still tri absolut best make special herthi film wouldnt work film way slow pace realli give viewer time take everyth small detail count excel film excel act great soundtrack highli recommend
"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul mescal francesca corio perform achingli beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth mealison willmor vultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit movi ive watch life isnt necessarili bad feel im confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need rewatch older fulli appreci movi first watch im confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",one thing movi subtl nuanc someth els entir enigmat cryptic regrett debut featur writerdirector charlott well deliv latter former melanchol charact studi tell stori woman celia rowlsonhal look back year vacat perki yearold self franki corio took young love quietli troubl father paul mescal explor subject memori parentchild relationship mental emot wellb variou sen loss experi time topic protagonist youth counterpart may fulli understood time adult self wish could say though often felt task construct narr pictur base essenti mere shown materi frequent come across underdevelop open array interpret term stori line charact develop put simpli didnt feel given enough substanc work accomplish task often left feel want abandon filmmak ultim uninterest complic matter film poor sound qualiti regularli obscur charact dialogu behind thick scottish accent oftendark overli muddl cinematographi made imag difficult deciph time what offer camera work aim simul glorifi home movi fit approach tell stori pack innocu materi inde realli care sit endless footag charact engag mundan activ like play video game eat ice cream attempt sing karaok look back fond factor supposedli touch segment littl inan engend truli hearttug feel constitut cinemat pad anyth integr meaning overal stori consid advanc glow reaction read releas realli look forward go unfortun though came away almost sad disappoint protagonist
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",there feel leav grew dont total belong againfor past week ive heard read lot peopl reaction film seen noth unhind love affect worri reason worri sea sceptic swept overbear expect slowli grew deep within conscienc doubt film would live ive seen say certainti way never assumedwhen movi end credit began roll sat silenc loss word depriv sensibl express genuin felt asid provid insight depress soul break open portal selfloath person innermost despair impress aspect made instant connect seamlessli film put across messag without ever becom preachi condescend portrayalth touch relationship paul franki calum sophi add much stori inher ambit long time forgot actor come differ background almost felt like watch reallif father daughter spend qualiti time togeth remind good old day use fatherperhap film simplifi depict realiti overwhelm relat made fall love cant get enough
"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",move film girl reminisc holiday turkey taken estrang father year prior use music terrif two central perform touchingli deliv paul mescal young franki corio one film fact charlott well debut featur noth astonish deliv massiv assur confid direct push narr forward tenderli girl sophi tri reconcil relationship father callum two separ timelinesalong way given snippet father troubl well cleverli weav subtext work crescendo last minut includ one brilliant transit shot recent cinema hyperbol realli brilliant viewer invit join dot happen two timelin sever clue helpwel debut familiar work fellow scottish director lynn ramsay particular film morvern callar feel lie birth anoth great director
"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",im alway happi see debut featur new filmmak charlott well newest addit list lynn ramsay ruth paxton anoth brilliant scottish filmmak featur debut aftersun produc barri jenkin adel romanski stori revolv around sophi father calum divorce must care minor daughter cope loneli mental healthth film open handi cam footag calum first glanc seem almost happi pose answer question sophi frame paus follow glitch footag follow flashback elevenyearold sophi vacat dad full light happi moment share alway fade bitter till last goodbyedont think yet anoth traumat arthous film ambigu narr drag go nowher promis plot smart immers avidli sometim choke happen screen difficult resist draw parallel real life might feel person stori life stori friend woven filmfirstli issu rais film like comingofag loneli blown proport doesnt scream loud even chic sophist stage filter fatherdaught relationship doesnt fall stereotyp bond shot beauti unlik hollywood director strongli exagger one hand love director us locat reveal charact expos empti famou music accompani background scoresecondli kudo charlott well cleverli regist emot though never explain dialogu fact littl explain atmospher film love stage particular scene sophi take small glanc keyhol watch girl hand job gestur brag friend mani thing would gone wrong appreci well draw line keep thing delic throughout runtimecom perform paul mescal capabl transmit tenac great fragil shot stare abyss intern conflict lie dormant deep within danc scene give best hold viewer atmospher melancholi empathi time best father especi bare back shot sob brilliant without excess melodrama scene cut letter written sophiefranki corio magnific first act debut yearold seem like role destin play tailor made charact matur whimsic cute dramat intens strike balanc emot inhabit typic yearold mental lot curios like director use hookah pot instead dumb question regist innoc hang michael dont introduc first meet happen second time rank list favourit child perform along stanislaw rózewicz birth certif shinji sômai move dorota kedzierzawska crow patricio kaulen long journey kjell grede hugo josephin amir naderi runner mariana rondón bad hair yare zelek lamb achero mañass el bola toni gatlif mondo nabil ayouch ali zaoua princ street héctor babenco pixot viktora starosa love headmistress xhanfis keko tomka friend maciej dejczer mile heaven lynn ramsay ratcatch byambasuren davaa cave yellow dog david zellner kidth terenc davi long day close samira makhmalbaf appl yong kim treeless mountain céline sciamma tomboy andré wood machuca catherin breillat fat girl jacqu doillon ponett akihiko shiota canari manoel de oliveira anikibóbó andrey zvyagintsev return ken loach ke shane meadow england karel kachyna high wall vittorio de sica child watch u wojciech marczewski weiser jan sverák kolya petar lalov bird cant fli pavel chukhray thief sooil jeon girl black soil loui mall zazi dan le metro claud jutra mon oncl antoin françoi truffaut blow lass hallström life dog cari joji fukunaga beast nation yoon gaeun world u ingmar bergman fanni alexand lev golub devochka ishchet otsagirl seek father yuan zhang littl red flower sean baker florida project edward yang yi yi carlo saura cria cuervo close recommend everyon find bore love slow burn drama prepar sail along sunni side turkey well paint portrait life mental ill fatherhood say least center arthous narr guarante film sensit make strike heart symmetri two protagonist alon
"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",teenag girl sophi father calum journey seasid resort turkey brief moment vacat sinc parent separ life mother sophi rare get opportun spend time dad swim snorkel togeth share meal room talk import thing life two begin truli bond happi cherish memori form yet problem depress alcohol doubt surfac well sophi calum attempt ride wave lift easili take underaftersun intim move portrait father daughter relationship accord director toronto intern film festiv screen loos base real peopl life camera work intent unsteadi point view sophi film techniqu meant evok sensat sophi look back treasur memori pictur show occasion jump forward time adult sophi reflect memori mean person charact gradual reveal audienc chanc medit areaftersun featur debut charlott well deepli person first appear cann tremend move danc sequenc alon worth watch entir film mechan aftersun act imag stori construct etc sound realli rise ordinari stir central theme shape memori hold import thing wish say love often dont get chanc say live wherev want whoever want calum tell sophi talk anyth
"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem.

"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",go tide aftersun say dont think great movi written direct sophi well aftersun tell stori sophi franki corio reflect summer holiday father calum play paul mescal year reflect key moment holiday tri reconcil differ father year old father come know sinceth stori told partial flashback primarili set summertim give film dreami nostalg atmospher cinematographi captur beauti turkey landscap sundrench beach vibrant colour easi feel immers sophi world reflect father suffer deep depress unawar ofunfortun aftersun fail deliv compel stori film slow pace lack charact develop make hard connect charact dont get much insight sophi life father make difficult feel emot invest relationshipth dialogu often stilt awkward attribut well inexperi writerdirector also reli heavili flashback becom tediou due lack depth charactersaftersun also suffer lack narr drive real stake tension stori essenti drama success film meander sophi memori without realli go anywher eventu end abrupt unsatisfi resolutionth perform corio mescal adequ dont quit make shortcom script corio captur sophi innoc confus reflect father past mescal also bring sens sad regret role help make relationship sophi father believableoveral aftersun fall short compel drama lack narr drive charact develop fail tug heartstr meaning may moment beauti doesnt quit make lacklustr storytel overal experi
Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio. That little girl is really good.,sophi reexamin vacat father twenti year earlier use video tape record father calum paul mescal father struggl person issu sophi franki corio young girl enjoy vacat father unawar father troublesmost feel like home movi lack exposit realli need plot element adult sophi movi need someth wrap around old vacat good movi come perform mescal newcom franki corio littl girl realli good
"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry. I can't even think of this movie without feeling knots in my throat.This is such a heartbreaking portrait of parenthood with depression, specifically the perpetual pursuit of keeping that side of you from your child, for the sake of making lasting memories with them.The little details and layers upon layers to the characters is just spectacular. The performances left me totally speechless. The subtlety and the natural flow of the dialogue and interactions takes a screenwriter with a DEEP understanding of the human condition.It isn't until we get older that we begin to understand the true anxiety and despair of being an adult, being our parents, and that the vision we had of our future selves at 11 years old was totally unrealistic and ridiculous, specifically for those of us whose anxiety and depression reveals itself to us later in life.",rememb time film made cri cant even think movi without feel knot throatthi heartbreak portrait parenthood depress specif perpetu pursuit keep side child sake make last memori themth littl detail layer upon layer charact spectacular perform left total speechless subtleti natur flow dialogu interact take screenwrit deep understand human conditionit isnt get older begin understand true anxieti despair adult parent vision futur self year old total unrealist ridicul specif u whose anxieti depress reveal u later life
"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.",aftersun quietli devast british drama firsttim director charlott well demonstr understand cinema rare see even experienc hand film frame older sophi reminisc vacat took father calum nd birthday turkey watch footag taken small camcord film spend runtim observ daili activ sophi calum vacat cheap turkish resort larg drive conflict sequenc certainli arent bore director well cinematograph gregori oke found way fill everi frame clue hint heartbreak detail two charact differ struggl go life arent appar daili routin learn sophi come age tri make sens relationship father boy film like spielberg fabelman give glossyold school hollywood vibe come age moment aftersun will let audienc sit back observ charact interact come conclus film deal disenchant parent mysteri futur think aftersun passiv vibe much effect creat reflect melancholi least relat anyway also learn everyth okay calum either exactli leav discov time film come close act observ viewer piec mani film strand togeth way final sequenc holiday film confirm sneak suspicion emot wallop film truli earn cheap sentiment soar score left tear long credit revel film quietli someth els entir time aftersun masterpiec speak volum say littl film answer solut observ memori time regret parent especi parent love felt despit fault despit suffer never knew
"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",one thing say film aftersun afraid subtleti human realism core deal theme childhood fatherhood respons class vulner opposit dramat yet keep engag glu screen care charact despit simplic day day interact paul mescal play callum young father yearold somewhat precoci girl name sophi film opinion father tri best maintain rock like mask convey strength stabil daughter emot vulner underneath occasion throughout film mask slip littl bit callum struggl bear respons dad young age face person troubl time daughter get older wiser start explor world adolesc holiday also begin notic father vulner sensit film one leaf enthral attach charact deepli human level even dramat colonel doesnt pop way might except
"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.",summaryth director charlott well offer u moros autobiograph stori point view subtleti dead time combin intent convey protagonist nostalgia lost father paradis inevit understood time film tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss latentreviewa woman recal vacat father turkish spa year oldaftersun unfortun conjunct four topic wide cover fiction autobiograph point view subtleti dead timeswhen creator creator face stori autobiograph element alway risk fall narciss memori invok especi way expos interest one write film nostalgia gener produc reson readerspect everyon anni ernaux elena ferrant woodi allen steven spielberg even joanna hogg go relat style charlott well clearli isntwith respect point view director screenwrit debut film narrat perpect adult rescu memori child maintain nostalg cutout look child perhap fill gap relat realiti love father young hide malais seen long time discomfort take long emerg surfac placid coexist tension child adult perspect naiveti understand experi loss alway interest case perhap strobe light adult sophi danc repres fragment rescu past tension consolid aftersun success vignett le placid everyday life enough appli sunscreen postsunscreen aftersun titleand point view selfimpos clip also link subtleti idl time innumer exampl subtl stori dead time time power case success placid vignett stay hotel season inevit home video tri rescu lost paradis weak omin shadow immers viewer slow time frankli soporif storyfranki corio natur compos charm girl sophi paul mescal handsom beach attend dark daughter perhap look young young father nevertheless compos sensit
